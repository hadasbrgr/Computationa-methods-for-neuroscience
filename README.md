# Computationa-methods-for-neuroscience

find the skeleton of a code for a classifier, as well as a text file containing the results of simulated neural inputs. Each sample is a list of neural inputs (some excitatory and some inhibitory). The label of each sample is 1 if the inputs caused an action potential and -1 otherwise.
